What works now? 

Getting text from text box to Database. Retrieving it. (in real time). Next? Get it to appear on other client machines.

Need to populate messages. Then have them change or flag, a node, that there are un-downloaded messages.

Also, working typing new message on a mobile device.

Then a side panel for scrolling through Chatrooms.

Current FFP Steps:
- setUID(<UID>)
- attachBoxListener() - html page
- makeNewBoxListener() - listener for Firebase
- attachBoxListener()
